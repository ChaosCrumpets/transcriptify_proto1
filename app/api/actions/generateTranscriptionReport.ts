      cleanedTranscript: `The future of energy is at a critical turning point. For decades, we've relied on fossil fuels, but the climate crisis demands a rapid transition to cleaner sources. The good news is that we're witnessing an unprecedented wave of innovation in the renewable energy sector.\n\nOne of the most exciting developments is in solar technology. The efficiency of photovoltaic cells has skyrocketed. We're not just talking about incremental improvements anymore. New materials, particularly perovskites, are allowing us to capture more energy from the sun than ever before. This means more power from a smaller footprint, making solar viable for a wider range of applications.\n\nBut generating power is only half the battle. Storing it is the other. The biggest criticism of solar and wind has always been their intermittencyâ€”the sun doesn't always shine, and the wind doesn't always blow. That's where battery technology comes in. We're now able to build massive, grid-scale batteries that can store excess energy and release it when needed, ensuring a stable and reliable power supply. This is a game-changer.\n\nFinally, we're seeing a shift in how we think about the grid itself. The old model of large, centralized power plants is giving way to a more distributed network of microgrids. These smaller, localized grids can operate independently, which dramatically increases resilience against outages caused by extreme weather or other disruptions. It's about making our energy system not just cleaner, but smarter and more robust.`,
